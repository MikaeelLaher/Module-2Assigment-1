                <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                <P> Elephants are the largest living land animals.
                    Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant,
                    the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.They are the only surviving members
                    of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths
                    and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk,
                    tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. 
                    The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks,
                    which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects
                     and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as 
                     in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants 
                     have smaller ears and convex or level backs.
                </P>
                <P>The African bush elephant is the largest terrestrial animal. Cows are 2.2to2.6 m  tall at
                  the shoulder and weigh 2,160 to 3,232 kg , while bulls are 3.2 to 4 m  tall and
                  weigh 4,700to6,048 kg . Its back is concave-shaped, while the back of the African forest elephant
                   is nearly straight. The largest recorded individual stood 3.96 metres  at the shoulder, and is estimated
                 to have weighed 10,400 kg . The tallest recorded individual stood 4.21 m  at the shoulder and weighed 
                 8,000 kg .</P>
