                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <P> The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, 
                    is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white c
                    oat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the 
                    red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant 
                    panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
                     Giant pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat 
                    in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, 
                    fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
                </P>
                <P> The giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding 
                    in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan. 
                    Giant pandas are generally solitary.[61] Each adult has a defined territory and a female 
                    is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during 
                    the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. After 
                    mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.
