                <h3>Giraffe</h3>
                <P> The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. 
                    It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
                    Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, 
                    with nine subspecies.The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its 
                    extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. 
                    It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, 
                    the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the 
                    south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs 
                    and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily 
                    acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</P>
                <P>Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3 to 5.7 m  tall, with males taller than females. The average 
                    weight is 1,192 kg for an adult male and 828 kg  for an adult female.Despite its long neck 
                    and legs, its body is relatively short.The skin is mostly gray, or tan, and can reach a
                    thickness of 20 mm . The 80 to 100 cm long tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is 
                    used as a defense against insects.</P>
