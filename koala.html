                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <P> The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes called koala bear, is an arboreal 
                    herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative 
                    of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. 
                    The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, 
                    inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</P>
                <P>It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, 
                    fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 
                    60 to 85 cm  and weighs 4 to 15 kg . Fur colour ranges from 
                    silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically 
                    maller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations 
                    possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.</p>
