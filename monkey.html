                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                <P>  Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, 
                    also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians 
                    are counted as monkeys except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; 
                    however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making 
                    the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope.
                </P>
                <P> Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 mm 
                     with a 172 mm  tail and just over 100 g  in weight
                    ,to the male mandrill, almost 1 m  long and weighing up to 36 kg 
                    (.Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; 
                    diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, 
                    leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals including insects and spiders
