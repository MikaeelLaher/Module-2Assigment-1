                <h3>LION</h3>
                <P> The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native 
                    to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded 
                    head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; 
                    adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, 
                    forming groups called prides.The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs and shrublands. It is 
                    usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active 
                    at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and 
                    Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in 
                    sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India.

                <P>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively 
                    depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. 
                    Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species 
                    sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural 
                    depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all 
                    ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.
