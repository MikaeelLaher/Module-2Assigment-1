                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <P> Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the 
                    tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: 
                    the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies.
                    Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
                    Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide 
                    range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests 
                    of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres . 
                    Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with 
                    western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas 
                    living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.
                </P>
                <P>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, 
                    weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and 
                    sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The Eastern 
                    gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological 
                    differences. Gorillas tend to live 35 to 40 years in the wild.
