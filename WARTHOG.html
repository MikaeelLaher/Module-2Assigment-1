                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <P>The common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family 
                    (Suidae) found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. In the past, 
                    it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P. aethiopicus, but today that scientific name 
                    is restricted to the desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia.
                </P>
                <P>The common warthog is a medium-sized species, with a head-and-body length ranging from 0.9 
                    to 1.5 m , and shoulder height from 63.5 to 85 cm. Females, at 45 to 75 kg , are smaller 
                    and lighter than males, at 60 kg to 
                    150 kg .A warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks 
                    protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. The lower pair, which is far shorter than 
                    the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth 
                    is opened and closed. The upper canine teeth can grow to 25.5 cm  long and have a 
                    wide elliptical cross section, being about 4.5 cm  deep and 2.5 cm  wide. 
                    A tusk will curve 90Â° or more from the root, and will not lie flat on a table, as it 
                    curves somewhat backwards as it grows. The tusks are not used for digging,[6] but are 
                    used for combat with other hogs and in defense against predators the lower set can 
                    inflict severe wounds.
                </P>
