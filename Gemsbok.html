                <h3>Gemsbok</h3>
                <P> Gemsbok are light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the
                     rump. Their tails are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin 
                     down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the 
                     lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. They have muscular necks
                      and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both
                       the front legs, and both sexes have long, straight horns. Comparably, the East African 
                       oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail, has less black on the legs (none on 
                       the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. One very rare color morph is the 
                       "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden.
                    </P>
                <p>Gemsbok are found in arid and semi-arid bushlands in southwestern Africa, especially around 
                    the Namib and Kalahari deserts, in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa and formerly Angola
                     (where they are considered extirpated).
